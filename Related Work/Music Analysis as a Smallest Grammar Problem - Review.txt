Overall it feels that the article focuses more on the shortest grammar problem, rather than its applicaiton in music.

Section 2
The objection function is defined as the sum of the lenght of rules, the lenght of rule being its right side plus 1.
|G|=Sum(|Ri|+1)
This is exactly how the objection function is defined for compression problem as introducing a new rule has cost of |R|+1.
However,since the problem is not compression, we should not be governed by its objectives. Therefore, I would probably define as:
|G|=Sum(|Ri|)
This will favor having more rules.

Section 2.1
In this section it's not quite clear how a musical piece is actually represented. It seems that it is chromatic, but not sure.
Also, it's not clear if two passages are deemed similar if they are not in the same keys and/or transposed by a diatonic interval.
